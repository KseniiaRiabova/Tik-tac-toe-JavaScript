## Tic Tac Toe
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game allows two players to take turns placing their respective symbols (X and O) on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
